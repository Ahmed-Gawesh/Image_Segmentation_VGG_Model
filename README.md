# Image Segmentation with VGG19
This repository contains a Python-based image segmentation project that utilizes the VGG19 convolutional neural network for segmenting images. The project is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and leverages popular libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform image segmentation, where the model identifies and separates different regions or objects within an image. The provided Jupyter Notebook (Segmentation.ipynb) loads a pre-trained VGG19 model, processes training images and their corresponding masks, and prepares the data for segmentation tasks.
Key components:

1- Dataset: Images and their corresponding masks stored in the images/train_data and images/masks directories.
2- Model: Pre-trained VGG19 with frozen layers for feature extraction.
3- Preprocessing: Images and masks are resized to 512x512 pixels and converted to appropriate formats (RGB for images, grayscale for masks).
4- Output: Visualization of segmentation predictions using Matplotlib.


# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.10+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
opencv-python
matplotlib
tensorflow or keras
glob2



You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib tensorflow glob2


# Prepare the Dataset:

Place your training images in the images/train_data/ directory.
Place the corresponding masks in the images/masks/ directory.
Ensure all images are in .png format.


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv mynewvenv
source mynewvenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: mynewvenv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have a requirements.txt file, create one with the following content:
numpy
pandas
opencv-python
matplotlib
tensorflow
glob2


Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Segmentation.ipynb

Follow the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, load the VGG19 model, and visualize the results.


# Usage

Data Loading:

The notebook loads images from images/train_data/ and masks from images/masks/.
Images are resized to 512x512 pixels and converted to RGB format.
Masks are loaded in grayscale and resized to match the image dimensions.


Model:

The VGG19 model is loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights, excluding the top layers.
All layers are set to non-trainable to use VGG19 as a feature extractor.


Visualization:

The notebook includes a cell to visualize the segmentation output using Matplotlib.
The output is displayed as a grayscale image representing the predicted mask.


Extending the Project:

Add additional cells to train a custom segmentation model on top of VGG19.
Include test data processing by adding code to load and preprocess images from images/test_data/.
Implement evaluation metrics (e.g., IoU, Dice coefficient) to assess segmentation performance.



# Notes

The current notebook does not include training or evaluation steps. You may need to add code for model training, loss functions, and metrics depending on your use case.
Ensure the images/ directory structure matches the expected paths in the notebook.
The VGG19 model is memory-intensive; ensure your system has sufficient resources (e.g., GPU support for faster processing).
